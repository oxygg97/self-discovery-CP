- Name your professional objective (SMART):
	* Specific: I’m going to help the team communicate better to free up time wasted on communication inefficiencies. 
		    This way, the team can spend this time on their core responsibilities instead.
	* Measurable: Our time-tracking software shows that team members spend an average of 1.5 hours per day on email.
		      We aim to cut this time in half to 45 minutes per day.
	* Achievable: We can avoid the confusion created by long email chains with a team messaging solution like Slack.
                      If we implement a messaging solution, it’s plausible that we can drastically reduce the time spent on email.
	* Relevant: I want to empower my team to produce their best work and increase their impact by reducing time wasted
                    on unnecessary and inefficient tasks.
	* Time-bound: We will implement a messaging solution within two weeks and half the time spent on communication within the next month.
